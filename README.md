# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Differential Equations

This project demonstrates the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using TensorFlow to solve differential equations, specifically focusing on the Helmholtz equation. PINNs incorporate the governing physical laws (e.g., differential equations) into the loss function of a neural network, enabling the network to learn solutions that adhere to these laws.

## Overview

The Helmholtz equation, often encountered in problems of physics and engineering, describes phenomena such as electromagnetic waves, acoustics, and the behavior of quantum mechanical systems. This project tackles the Helmholtz equation by leveraging the power of PINNs, integrating the equation's boundary conditions and differential form directly into the neural network's training process. 

We define a neural network model to approximate the solution, apply Dirichlet boundary conditions, and construct a custom loss function that encapsulates both the Helmholtz equation and the boundary conditions. The network is trained to minimize this loss, guiding it towards solutions that satisfy the differential equation.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
3. Run the script to train the model and visualize the solutions:

```sh
python your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of the Python script provided in this repository.

The script performs the following steps:
- Defines the neural network model structure for PINNs.
- Applies Dirichlet boundary conditions to the Helmholtz equation.
- Defines a custom loss function incorporating the equation and boundary conditions.
- Trains the model for different values of `k` in the Helmholtz equation.
- Visualizes the loss over epochs, the comparison between the PINN-predicted solution and the analytical solution, and the residuals.

## Features

- **Flexible Neural Network Architecture:** Easily adjust the network's depth and width by modifying the `layers` variable.
- **Customizable Training Regime:** Set the learning rate and number of epochs as desired.
- **Comparison with Analytical Solutions:** Automatically compares the PINN solutions to analytical solutions (when available) for validation.
- **Visualization:** Includes plotting capabilities to visualize the training process, solution comparison, and residuals.
