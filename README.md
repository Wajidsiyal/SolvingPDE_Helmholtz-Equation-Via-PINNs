Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for Differential Equations
This project demonstrates the implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) using TensorFlow to solve differential equations, specifically focusing on the Helmholtz equation. PINNs incorporate the governing physical laws (e.g., differential equations) into the loss function of a neural network, enabling the network to learn solutions that adhere to these laws.

Overview
The Helmholtz equation, often encountered in problems of physics and engineering, describes phenomena such as electromagnetic waves, acoustics, and the behavior of quantum mechanical systems. This project tackles the Helmholtz equation by leveraging the power of PINNs, integrating the equation's boundary conditions and differential form directly into the neural network's training process.

We define a neural network model to approximate the solution, apply Dirichlet boundary conditions, and construct a custom loss function that encapsulates both the Helmholtz equation and the boundary conditions. The network is trained to minimize this loss, guiding it towards solutions that satisfy the differential equation.

Installation
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:
